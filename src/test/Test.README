Overview:
   The test suite relies on a new project created in Cucumber to support BDD style tests
   Assertions are currently done using Junit

To execute the tests:
   Start the service using "gradle run"
   Start the tests using "gradle cucumberCli"

Docker-compose issues:
   Unfortunately the Docker-compose files do not work and I was unable to complete these in the time given.

Suggested improvements to test suite

Technical:
   Use of id by default is one - this should be refactored as sometimes we're not interested in setting it and want to leave it blank to get the incremented value that the system produces.
   Some data considerations - an assumption is made that id 1000 is unknown for instance
   Refactor test code to reduce duplication such as repeated use of new CollateralData
   These tests would not work concurrently, we need to refactor for parallelisation

Test coverage:
   In the tests where a value is not present, this does not include where the field is absent altogether. These tests should be added.
   Many other tests exist in terms of the data that is fed into post and get calls that I have not added here due to time constraints (e.g. giving a negative number to the get, does it fail gracefully)

Service improvements:
   More informative error messages for the user
   More defensive error handling
   API documentation
